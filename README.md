## ‚ú® Features

- Supports customizable port range input from the user.
- Scans ports concurrently using Python's multithreading for faster execution.
- Timeout for each port connection to avoid hanging.
- Reports open and closed ports with clear status updates.
- Displays the total time taken to complete the scan.
- Basic exception handling for invalid IP and port range inputs.
